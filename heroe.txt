1-Sealing light
2-Nothing to see
3-Like a miracle life
4-Starts with the pain
5-Forever this will be
6-Close my eyes
7-Thunders won't cease
8-Crawling down to the edge
9-I break down and weep
10-Tears on the river deep
11-Oh! Back to the sea
12-Shout loud
13-Moving ahead
14-Ride the horses of justice
15-Virtues of men, yawns!
16-Down and out
17-Losing my head
18-Like a dream you're returning
19-Back from the dead-awake!
20-Shadows will fade some day
21-All the heroes go down
22-Shed their blood on the land
23-Dreaming somehow
24-The divine will now stand
25-Heroes go down
26-With their hearts in their hands
27-Building their castles on the sand
28-Haunted by the heavy clouds
29-Thunder scaring away
30-Howling like a mountain wolf
31-Warriors are leading the way
